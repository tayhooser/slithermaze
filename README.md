# Slithermaze

Slithermaze is a web-based application of the popular Slitherlink puzzle genre originally created by Nikoli.<br>
This project was made for CSUB's 2024 Senior Project.

### How to Play

The goal of the game is to create a single loop around a grid of dots by placing lines. Some cells have numbers within, limiting how many lines the player can place around a given cell. Once the puzzle is complete, the player is left with a single loop with no loose ends, intersections, or smaller subloops.<br>
